# Rigid-Body-Simulation

This is a a Rigid Body Simulator using Forward Dynamics. I simulate the motion of a dice when its thrown in the mid-air with an 
arbitrary initial velocity, and then the dice should drop and bounce on the ground floor and 
rotate etc. The default coding environment is using Python, PyGame and PyOpenGL.

## Control
You can start the simulation by pressing ‘s’ on your 
keyboard. This would run the simulation till you explicitly close the window, or restart the 
simulation using key ‘r’. Each time key ‘n’ is pressed, one more timestep is simulated and 
displayed. You can also pause the simulation by pressing ‘p’.
